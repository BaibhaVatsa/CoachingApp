## New Branch Workflow:

### 1. Create new branch for each new feature you work on
    a. Checkout Master branch with "git checkout master"
    b. Create new branch from master with "git checkout -b <new-branch>"
    c. Add changes
    d. Commit `git commit -m "message"`
    e. Push `git push`
    
### 2. Creating Pull Requests
