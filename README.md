## New Branch Workflow:

### 1. Create new branch for each new feature you work on
    a. Checkout Master branch with "git checkout master"
    b. Create new branch from master with "git checkout -b <new-branch>"
  
### 2. Merge Branch back into Master
    a. Checkout Master branch with "git checkout master"
    b. Pull your branch with "git merge <your-branch>
    c. Resolve any merge conflicts
    d. Commit the merge with "git commit -m "Your message about your commit"
    e. Push to master with "git push origin master"
